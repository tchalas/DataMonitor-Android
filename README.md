# DataMonitor-Android

On the Android part of the application, we use again soap webservices to send information to the MonitorData database and 
we also represent some info about the devices on android graphic enviroment. The information we collect are about
the GPS, the battery level and some generic information. For that we use activities and services in a coordinated way.
